# 00 — Overview & Scope

## Purpose

Define what StringArtIt is, the core mental model behind the editor, and the boundary between MVP, Phase 2, and future/out-of-scope work. This document is the entry point for all other specs in `docs/specs/`.

## Product Overview

StringArtIt is a browser-based design tool for creating physical string-art/string-line boards. The user defines a board, places virtual pins/nails along geometric paths, and creates thread paths by connecting those pins.

The editor is built around three independent concepts:

1. **Board / Background**
2. **Pins / Nails**
3. **Threads / Lines**

Pins and threads are independent object types with separate layer systems (see [13-layers.md](./13-layers.md)).

StringArtIt must behave as a **structured vector/geometric editor**, not a bitmap painting application. The fundamental model:

```text
Shape
  ↓
Geometric Path
  ↓
Pins
  ↓
Thread Connections
```

Meaningful geometry must remain editable at every stage — a circle stays a circle, an octagon stays an octagon, a thread path stays a path of pin references. See the [Product Principle](#product-principle) below.

## Main Product Goals

The application must allow users to:

- Define a physical board and configure its real-world dimensions and appearance.
- Create pin arrangements geometrically, with precise control over pin spacing.
- Snap geometry to grid intersections and to existing pins.
- Create symmetrical pin arrangements (mirror and radial).
- Draw threads exclusively between pins.
- Create single-colour or multi-colour twisted threads.
- Organize pins and threads into separate layer systems, with hide/lock support.
- Select and modify existing objects rather than redrawing them.
- Undo and redo changes.
- Print physical construction templates.
- Export designs.
- Save and reload projects.

## Recommended Development Sequence

```text
Phase A — Geometry Engine
  1. Coordinate system
  2. Paths
  3. Length calculation
  4. Point-at-distance
  5. Open pin distribution
  6. Closed pin distribution
  7. Polygon/star geometry
  8. Arc geometry
  9. Transformations
  10. Snapping
  11. Snap radius
  12. Symmetry
  13. Automated tests

Phase B — Board & Viewport
  Board creation, board appearance, grid, zoom, pan, physical coordinate conversion

Phase C — Pin Editor
  Pin Paths, drawing tools, live preview, guide lines, pin properties, selection, editing, eraser

Phase D — Symmetry
  Horizontal, Vertical, Both, Radial, linked instances, movable centre

Phase E — Thread Editor
  Spatial pin lookup, candidate highlighting, preview, Thread Path creation,
  thread termination, spiral rendering, eraser

Phase F — Layers
  Pin layers, thread layers, visibility, locking, ordering, duplication

Phase G — Commands
  All mutations go through an undoable command architecture (Execute / Undo / Redo)

Phase H — Persistence
  Project schema, save, load, versioning

Phase I — Print & Export
  Print preview, physical scaling, calibration, tiling, SVG, PDF, raster export
```

This sequence should drive implementation order: the geometry engine (Phase A) has no UI dependency and should be fully unit-tested before any canvas rendering is built on top of it.

## Remaining Minor Product Decisions

These are lower-level UX/configuration decisions that do not change the architecture and can be decided during detailed UI/UX design:

- Default nearest-pin snap radius in pixels
- Default pin diameter
- Default pin spacing
- Default grid size
- Default guide-line width
- Whether snap radius is user-configurable or a fixed application default
- Default radial symmetry centre indicator appearance
- Exact UI for rotating polygons/stars during creation
- Default spiral pitch for two/three-colour threads
- Default print overlap for tiled pages

## Product Principle

> **Never reduce meaningful geometry to pixels.**

The application should understand:

```text
This is an arc.
This is an octagon.
These pins belong to that path.
This thread connects these pins.
These shapes are generated by this symmetry rule.
```

rather than storing only:

```text
pixels
coordinates
unrelated line segments
```

This principle enables: accurate geometry, object editing, uniform pin spacing, snapping, symmetry, layering, undo/redo, physical printing, material calculations, and future automated pattern generation. Every spec in this folder must be read with this principle as the tie-breaker when a design decision is ambiguous.
