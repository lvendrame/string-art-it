# 13 — Layers

## Purpose

Define the two independent layer systems (Pin Layers, Thread Layers) and the operations available on each.

## Functional Requirements

Two independent layer systems are required:

```text
PIN LAYERS

👁 🔒 Outer Circle
👁 🔓 Inner Star
○  🔓 Decoration


THREAD LAYERS

👁 🔒 Red Pattern
👁 🔓 Blue Pattern
○  🔓 Detail
```

Pin layers and Thread layers remain fully separate lists — a Pin Layer never contains Thread Paths and vice versa.

## Layer Operations

Each layer supports:

- Create
- Rename
- Delete
- Duplicate
- Reorder
- Show
- Hide
- Lock
- Unlock
- Select all objects (on that layer)

## Guarantees

- **Hidden layers retain their contents.** Hiding is purely visual; hidden objects are not deleted and still participate in document logic where relevant (e.g. a hidden Pin Layer's pins can still be referenced by threads, though editors may choose to warn about connecting to hidden pins).
- **Locked layers cannot be modified.** No create/move/resize/rotate/erase/property-change operation succeeds against an object on a locked layer (see [09-selection-and-editing.md](./09-selection-and-editing.md), [11-erasers.md](./11-erasers.md)).
- Deleting a layer deletes all objects it contains, as a single undoable operation (see [10-undo-redo.md](./10-undo-redo.md)).
- Duplicating a layer duplicates its objects with new stable IDs; any Thread Path referencing a duplicated pin still references the original pin's ID, not the duplicate's — duplication does not rewire thread connections.

## Test Cases

```gherkin
Feature: Independent layer systems

  Scenario: Pin layers and Thread layers are separate lists
    Given a project with 2 Pin Layers and 1 Thread Layer
    Then the Pin Layers list shows exactly 2 entries
    And the Thread Layers list shows exactly 1 entry
    And no Pin Path appears in the Thread Layers list

Feature: Layer CRUD operations

  Scenario: Creating a layer
    Given the Pin Layers panel
    When the user creates a new layer
    Then a new empty Pin Layer appears in the list, visible and unlocked by default

  Scenario: Renaming a layer
    Given a Pin Layer named "Layer 1"
    When the user renames it to "Outer Circle"
    Then the layer is displayed as "Outer Circle"

  Scenario: Deleting a layer removes all its contents in one undo step
    Given a Pin Layer "Decoration" containing 3 Pin Paths
    When the user deletes the layer
    Then the layer and all 3 Pin Paths are removed
    When the user invokes Undo once
    Then the layer and all 3 Pin Paths are restored

  Scenario: Duplicating a layer creates independent copies with new IDs
    Given a Pin Layer "Inner Star" containing 1 Pin Path with 20 pins
    When the user duplicates the layer
    Then a new layer "Inner Star copy" is created with a Pin Path containing 20 pins with new stable IDs distinct from the originals

  Scenario: Duplicated pins do not inherit existing thread connections
    Given a Pin Layer with pin-1 referenced by a Thread Path
    When the layer is duplicated, producing pin-1-copy
    Then the existing Thread Path still references pin-1 only
    And no Thread Path automatically references pin-1-copy

  Scenario: Reordering layers changes render/stacking order
    Given Pin Layers in order [A, B, C]
    When the user moves layer C above layer A
    Then the layer order becomes [C, A, B]

Feature: Visibility and locking guarantees

  Scenario: Hidden layer retains its contents
    Given a Pin Layer "Detail" with 5 Pin Paths, currently visible
    When the user hides the layer
    Then the layer is not rendered in the editor
    And all 5 Pin Paths still exist in the document data

  Scenario: Unhiding restores the exact same content
    Given the "Detail" layer is hidden per the prior scenario
    When the user shows the layer again
    Then the same 5 Pin Paths render, unchanged

  Scenario: Locked layer blocks modification
    Given a Pin Layer "Outer Circle" is locked
    When the user attempts to move, resize, or delete a Pin Path on that layer
    Then the operation is rejected and no change occurs

  Scenario: Unlocking restores editability
    Given the "Outer Circle" layer is locked
    When the user unlocks it
    Then Pin Paths on that layer can again be moved, resized, or deleted

  Scenario: Locked layer still allows visibility toggling
    Given a Pin Layer is locked
    When the user toggles its visibility
    Then the visibility changes successfully (lock only blocks content edits, not show/hide)

Feature: Select all objects on a layer

  Scenario: Select-all selects every object on that layer only
    Given a Pin Layer "Outer Circle" with 3 Pin Paths, and another layer "Inner Star" with 2 Pin Paths
    When the user invokes "Select all" on "Outer Circle"
    Then all 3 Pin Paths on "Outer Circle" become selected
    And the 2 Pin Paths on "Inner Star" remain unselected
```
