# 32 — Generator Mode

## Purpose

Add a sixth Editor mode, **Generate**, that auto-creates pins and threads from a chosen mathematical pattern and its parameters — instead of drawing shapes and threading pins by hand. The user picks a pattern from a dropdown, sets its parameters, and clicks **Generate** to preview a pin+thread pattern on the board; **Re-generate** replaces that preview; **Confirm** turns the preview into two brand-new, permanent Pin/Thread Layers.

This spec was researched against a read-only analysis of a competitor app's 19 built-in generator patterns (`~/projects/pocs/research_string_art`, not part of this repository). The finding that shaped this spec's scope: **all 19 researched patterns are pure parametric math** — pins built from circle/line/polygon primitives (single or composite: e.g. a hexagram from two overlapping triangles) or, for 2 of the 19, sampled along a closed-form parametric curve. None require a hand-drawn/freehand fallback in the "couldn't figure out the shape" sense, and none require image/photo input or greedy optimization. This spec ships the **engine** (pattern registry + Generate/Re-generate/Confirm workflow) and a **curated set of 5 patterns**, one representative of each engine capability; the other 14 researched patterns are architecturally identical (same registry shape) and are a follow-up milestone, not built here (see Scope below).

## Pin-count vs. pin-spacing

Every other pin-creating path in this app ([07-pin-geometry-engine.md](./07-pin-geometry-engine.md)) is **spacing-driven**: the user requests a physical gap (e.g. "1cm"), and the engine derives however many pins that implies. Generator patterns are **count-driven** instead (Mandala's `n`, Star's `circleNails`) — a pattern's thread-index math assumes an *exact* pin count, so an off-by-one would silently misroute threads. (Star of David is the one pattern that sidesteps this entirely — its nested-polygon tiles are built directly from computed vertex points, the same "pins ARE the computed positions" technique Spirals uses, since a fixed vertex count per nested level matters more than matching a physical spacing.)

`spacingForPinCount(length, count)` (`src/domain/paths/distribution.ts`) bridges the two: it derives a `requestedSpacing` that makes `distributeClosedPath`/`distributePathPerVertex`'s existing closest-interval-count algorithm land on *exactly* `count`, not just close to it, by biasing the spacing a hair smaller than the naive `length / count` (a floating-point safety margin — re-dividing the naive value can land a hair *below* the integer count and round down). Every generator pattern in this spec goes through this helper before calling the existing `createPinPath`, so pin distribution stays entirely inside the established engine — no new distribution algorithm was written.

## The 5 curated patterns

| Pattern | Pin layout | Threading | Parameters |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Mandala** | One circle, `n` pins | For layer `L` (angular shift `floor(n/layers)·L`): for every pin `i`, connect it to pin `(i·base) mod n`. Each layer is its own Thread Path/colour. | `n` (3–400), `base` (2–99), `layers` (1–20) |
| **Star** | A "spoke wheel," not a pointed-polygon outline: `starPoints` straight spokes (`"line"` `PinPathGeometry`, `sideNails` pins each) radiating from the board centre to the rim, plus one outer circle whose pin count (`starPoints·(sideNails-1)`) is derived from `sideNails` rather than set independently | THREE interleaved zigzag Thread Paths per neighbouring pair: 2 spoke↔circle zigzags per point (`starSpokeCircleZigzag`, one sweeping toward each neighbouring point, both pivoting on the shared boundary pin between them) + 1 direct spoke-to-spoke zigzag per adjacent pair (`starAdjacentSpokeZigzag`, bypassing the circle entirely) — a denser, more textured elaboration of the same curve-stitch idea Star of David and the earlier single-fan design already use. `3·starPoints` Thread Paths total | `sideNails` (2–200), `starPoints` (3–20), `starOuterRatio`/`starInnerRatio` (rim/hub radius as fractions of the board's inscribed radius), `rotation` |
| **Freestyle** | Up to 3 independent circles, each positioned/sized as a fraction of the board | Round-robin across every *enabled* circle: visit pin `r mod count` of each, for `r` from 0 to the largest enabled circle's pin count | Per circle: enabled, `nails`, `radiusRatio`, `centerXRatio`, `centerYRatio` |
| **Star of David** | 7 tiles — 1 central hexagon + 6 equilateral triangles centred on its 6 edges (each triangle's centre 30° off the nearest hexagon vertex, at radius `2·R0/3`; hexagon vertex radius `R0/√3`; triangle vertex radius `R0/3`, where `R0` is the board's inscribed radius) — each tile expanded into `depth` nested, shrinking-and-twisting copies of itself (`nestedPolygonLevels`), pins at every vertex of every nested copy | Per tile, per side: an alternating-parity fan across all `depth` nested levels (`connectTwoSidesLocalIndices`) — one Thread Path per `(tile, side)`, 6 + 6·3 = 24 total | `depth` (1–40, nested levels per tile), `layerAngle` (0.02–0.15, twist/shrink rate per level), `rotation`, `mirrorTiling` (flips the triangles' twist direction) |
| **Spirals** | `arms` polar-curve arms, `nailsPerSpiral` pins each, sampled directly (not resampled) into a `"freehand"` `PinPathGeometry` — the one pattern demonstrating the curve-sampled/freehand case | Sequential: connect every sampled pin in generation order (arm-major → inner, radial-step-major → outer), one continuous Thread Path | `arms` (2–20), `nailsPerSpiral` (3–300), `totalAngleTurns`, `rotation` |

All five threading rules reduce to pure index arithmetic over already-built pins (`src/domain/generator/roundRobin.ts`, `mandala.ts`, `nestedPolygon.ts`), matching the research finding that every one of the 19 researched patterns threads this way — never by re-deriving geometry mid-traversal.

**Deliberate simplification, stated plainly:** these are original formulas *inspired by* the researched competitor's pattern names and general shapes, not byte-identical reproductions of its exact traversal (which, for e.g. Star, branches on odd/even side count and uses reflected round indices — extra complexity that changes which of two visually similar conventions is used, not whether the pattern is achievable). Mathematical techniques like "connect pin i to pin i·k mod n" are generic string-art methods documented across many hobbyist sources, not unique IP.

**Post-ship correction (Star of David):** the first implementation modelled this pattern as two flat overlapping triangles round-robin-threaded together — topologically wrong, not just visually plainer. A side-by-side comparison against a live reference render (the same competitor app this spec's research was based on) showed the real construction is 7 independently-threaded nested-polygon tiles (1 hexagon + 6 triangles), each spiralling inward through `depth` shrinking/twisting copies of itself — that's what produces the dense inward swirl, not a flat outline. Re-derived from first principles and cross-checked numerically against the reference render's actual nail coordinates (radii and angles only — no source code or artwork was copied into this codebase): the outer tip radius equals the board's inscribed radius `R0` exactly, the central hexagon's own vertex radius is exactly `R0/√3`, and each triangle tile sits exactly 30° off the nearest hexagon vertex (centred on a hexagon edge) — all three facts matched this rebuild's formulas before any code changed to fit them.

## Draft / Confirm state machine

- **Generate** (`EditorStore.generatePattern(params, colours)`): builds a fresh `{ params, pinPaths, threadPaths }` draft from the current pattern/parameters/palette, replacing any existing draft outright. **Non-undoable** — same transient-interaction-state treatment as an in-progress Thread Path draft ([12-thread-editor.md](./12-thread-editor.md)): nothing here is committed to the document yet, so there is nothing meaningful to step back to mid-draft. Requires an explicit click the first time (the `Generate` button, shown only while no draft exists) — editing fields before that first click only changes local UI state, nothing is computed yet.
- **Live auto-apply (no "Re-generate" button).** Once a draft exists, `Generate` is replaced by a short "updates live" hint: any later pattern switch, parameter edit, or palette change re-runs `generatePattern` automatically, debounced ~300ms so a fast run of edits (typing a multi-digit number, several palette clicks) only recomputes once, from the final values — never on every intermediate keystroke. Fully replaces the previous draft each time; nothing from the old draft survives. (Earlier versions of this spec had an explicit `Re-generate` button doing the same thing on click; removed in favour of live auto-apply per direct user request, since every pattern here is a pure deterministic function of its parameters — there's never a reason to keep stale output on screen instead of the current settings' real result.)
- **Preview**: while a draft exists, its pins and threads render on the canvas at reduced opacity (`GeneratorPreviewOverlay`, reusing the existing `PinPathVisual`/`ThreadPathVisual` renderers) so it visibly reads as "not yet part of the document," on top of every real layer.
- **Confirm** (`EditorStore.confirmGeneratedPattern()`): the **only undoable step** in the whole flow. Always creates two **brand-new** permanent layers (named `"Generated — <Pattern Name>"`) holding the draft's pin/thread paths, appended in one bundled `SetValueCommand<{pinLayers, threadLayers}>` — a single Undo afterward removes both layers together. Confirm never merges into or otherwise touches an existing layer, so there is no locked-layer check to make. The newly created layers become the active Pin/Thread layers afterward (a non-undoable pointer switch, same precedent as `addPinLayer`/`addThreadLayer` switching the active layer right after their own undoable creation).
- **Leaving Generator mode** with an uncommitted draft discards it (`EditorStore.setMode`) — nothing was ever committed, so there is nothing to lose. Re-entering Generator mode later never resurrects a discarded draft.
- Loading a project (Open / autosave restore) also discards any in-progress draft, same as it already does for an in-progress Thread Path draft.

Pattern/parameter *selection* itself (which pattern is picked, what its fields currently say) is ordinary local UI state in `GeneratorPanel`, not document state — it resets on Re-generate anyway (a param edit is meant to change the next generated result) and is discarded along with the draft on leaving Generator mode, so there's nothing here worth persisting through `EditorStore`.

## Multicolor

`GeneratorPanel` holds an editable colour palette — one swatch per colour, plus `+`/`−` buttons to add/remove the last colour — analogous to `ThreadPropertiesPanel`'s existing 1/2/3-colour picker but variable-length rather than fixed at 3, since a generator pattern's useful colour count varies per pattern (and, for Mandala, per parameter).

- **Cap, not a fixed number.** `maxGeneratorColours(params)` (`src/application/document/generator/generatorPatterns.ts`) returns the largest number of colours a pattern's *current* parameters can actually put to use — the count of independent Thread Path "runs" it will produce:
  - **Mandala**: `layers` (each layer is already its own Thread Path).
  - **Star of David**: a fixed `24` (6 hexagon sides + 6 triangles × 3 sides), independent of `depth`/`mirrorTiling`.
  - **Star**: `3·starPoints` — 2 spoke↔circle zigzags + 1 adjacent-spoke zigzag per point (see the pattern table above).
  - **Freestyle, Spirals**: `1` — each threads as one continuous Thread Path (round-robin across circles, or visiting every sampled point in sequence); splitting either into independently-coloured runs would change what they draw, not just how they're coloured, so a 2nd colour would never be used by anything.
  - `+` is disabled once the palette reaches this cap; `−` is disabled at 1 colour (a pattern always has at least one).
- **Assignment rule: cycle by run index.** Run `i`'s Thread Path gets `colours[i % paletteLength]` as its *single* colour — never the whole palette handed to one Thread Path (that would render as a multi-strand twist within one run, per [12-thread-editor.md](./12-thread-editor.md)'s existing 1/2/3-colour twist rendering, a different feature). This is "each different colour is a different thread": a colour is only ever applied to a whole separate Thread Path, never blended into a shared multi-strand twist.
- The palette is `GeneratorPanel`'s own local UI state, passed explicitly into `EditorStore.generatePattern(params, colours)` — **not** read from or written to `state.threadDefaults.colours` (the global Thread-mode drawing default), so picking Generator colours never leaks into the next hand-drawn Thread Path's colour, and vice versa.
- Switching pattern, or lowering a parameter the cap depends on (e.g. Mandala's `layers`), clamps the *displayed and generated* palette down to the new cap without discarding hidden entries — raising the parameter back up restores the colours already picked rather than re-rolling from scratch.
- A new swatch (`+`) is seeded with the next colour from a small built-in preset (same auto-pick precedent as `ThreadPropertiesPanel`'s `PALETTE`), not left blank or repeating the previous swatch.

## Scope

- **This milestone ships 5 patterns** (Mandala, Star, Freestyle, Star of David, Spirals) — chosen to exercise every engine capability: single-shape modular math, a 2-shape composite, an N-shape composite, and the curve-sampled/freehand case. The other 14 patterns researched (Assymetry, Spiral, Wave, Vortex, Polygon, Flower, Maurer Rose, Flower of Life, Comet, Sun, Lotus, Dance of Planets, Crosses, Hexagon Spades) use the identical registry/engine shape and are a follow-up milestone, not built here — same MVP/Phase-2 split this project already uses ([00-overview-and-scope.md](./00-overview-and-scope.md)).
- **No image/photo-to-string-art mode** is in scope or was requested — the competitor research confirms none of its 19 patterns are image-based either. That would be a categorically different feature (image processing + greedy chord selection), not an extension of this engine.
- Confirm always creates new layers; it never offers to merge a generated pattern into an existing layer. A user who wants that can do it manually afterward with the existing Merge action ([26-edit-mode-multi-select.md](./26-edit-mode-multi-select.md)).
- The Generator mode's pins/threads are not integrated with Symmetry ([06-symmetry.md](./06-symmetry.md)) — patterns construct their own composite/rotated geometry directly and are not eligible for the Symmetry panel's mirror/radial config (same as every other non-Pin-mode object in the app).

## Test Cases

```gherkin
Feature: Generating a pattern

  Scenario: Generate builds a draft with the correct pin count
    Given Generator mode is active with the Mandala pattern and n=180
    When the user clicks Generate
    Then a draft with exactly 180 pins on one circle is created
    And the draft is rendered as a preview on the canvas
    And the action is not recorded in the undo history

  Scenario: The Generate button disappears once a draft exists
    Given no draft currently exists
    Then a "Generate" button is shown and no draft/preview exists
    When the user clicks it
    Then the "Generate" button is replaced by a live-update hint and a Confirm button

  Scenario: Editing a field live auto-applies (debounced), fully replacing the previous draft
    Given a Mandala draft with n=180 exists
    When the user changes n to 60
    Then the draft still has 180 pins immediately (not yet applied)
    When ~300ms pass with no further edits
    Then the draft now has exactly 60 pins
    And none of the previous 180 pins remain in the draft

  Scenario: A fast run of edits only regenerates once, from the final value
    Given a draft exists
    When the user changes a field's value three times within 300ms of each other
    Then only one regeneration happens, using the last value typed

  Scenario: Composite patterns build multiple Pin Paths in one draft
    Given Generator mode is active with the Star pattern
    When the user clicks Generate
    Then the draft contains one circle Pin Path and starPoints spoke (line) Pin Paths

  Scenario: Each point is woven from three local zigzags, not one shared weave
    Given Generator mode is active with the Star pattern (starPoints=5, sideNails=8)
    When the user clicks Generate
    Then the draft has exactly 15 Thread Paths (3 per point)
    And each point's 2 spoke↔circle Thread Paths only ever touch that spoke's pins and circle pins
    And each point's adjacent-spoke Thread Path only ever touches its own two neighbouring spokes

  Scenario: Spirals places pins via formula, not distributeClosedPath resampling
    Given Generator mode is active with the Spirals pattern (arms=3, nailsPerSpiral=80)
    When the user clicks Generate
    Then the draft's freehand Pin Path has exactly (80-1)*3 pins
    And each pin sits at its computed radius/angle, unmoved by arc-length resampling

Feature: Multicolor palette

  Scenario: The palette starts at 1 colour and Add is capped by the pattern's run count
    Given Generator mode is active with the Mandala pattern and layers=1
    Then exactly 1 colour swatch is shown
    And the Add-colour button is disabled

  Scenario: Raising a cap-driving parameter enables adding more colours
    Given Generator mode is active with the Mandala pattern
    When the user sets layers to 3
    Then the Add-colour button is enabled
    And clicking it up to 3 times adds up to 3 swatches, then disables Add again

  Scenario: Remove always drops the last swatch and stops at 1
    Given the palette has 2 colours
    When the user clicks Remove
    Then the palette has 1 colour
    And the Remove button is now disabled

  Scenario: Switching to a single-run pattern clamps the visible palette to 1
    Given the palette has 3 colours under the Mandala pattern
    When the user switches to the Star pattern
    Then only 1 colour swatch is shown

  Scenario: Generate colours each run from the palette, cycling by index
    Given Generator mode is active with the Mandala pattern, layers=3, and a 2-colour palette
    When the user clicks Generate
    Then the 3 generated Thread Paths' colours are [palette[0], palette[1], palette[0]]

Feature: Confirming a generated pattern

  Scenario: Confirm creates exactly 2 new permanent layers, as one undo step
    Given a generated draft exists
    When the user clicks Confirm
    Then a new Pin Layer and a new Thread Layer are appended to the document
    And the draft is cleared
    And the live-update hint is replaced by a "Generate" button again
    And the Confirm button disappears
    And a single Undo removes both new layers together

  Scenario: Confirm never modifies an existing layer
    Given the active Pin Layer already contains hand-drawn pins
    And a generated draft exists
    When the user clicks Confirm
    Then the active Pin Layer's existing content is unchanged
    And the generated pins land in a brand-new layer instead

  Scenario: The newly confirmed layers become active
    Given a generated draft exists
    When the user clicks Confirm
    Then the new Pin Layer becomes the active Pin Layer
    And the new Thread Layer becomes the active Thread Layer

Feature: Discarding an uncommitted draft

  Scenario: Switching Editor mode away discards the draft
    Given a generated draft exists in Generator mode
    When the user switches to Edit mode
    Then the draft is cleared
    And no partial layers were created

  Scenario: Re-entering Generator mode does not resurrect a discarded draft
    Given a draft was discarded by leaving Generator mode
    When the user switches back to Generator mode
    Then no draft or preview is shown
```
